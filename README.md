# apiServices
## Overview
This API is used as the route/method to signup / sign-in to the game app. Manages database for the overall application. 
## USER
As a user I would like the following:
   * A secure way to signup / signin.
   * An app that will store my wins / losses
## Developer
As a developer I would like an API that did the following:
   * Secures the signin / signup
   * An API that sends a token that the app will use throughout the users game to securely transfer their information( user name, wins, loses, opponents, other relevant data that we foresee in the future) 
   * An API that sends and receives information to and from Client and Game servers.
   * An API that will support multiple users at the same time and able to store their data. 
   * Have unit tests which assures the developers that everything is working correctly.
